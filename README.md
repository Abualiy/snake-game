# Anaconda Snake Game

A classic Snake game built with **React Native** using Expo. The game allows you to control the snake to collect food, grow in size, and avoid hitting walls or your own tail. It includes difficulty levels, score tracking, and high score functionality.

## Features

- **Classic Snake Gameplay**: Control the snake with a virtual joystick to collect food and grow.
- **Difficulty Levels**: Choose between Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulties that affect the speed of the game.
- **High Score Tracking**: Stores the highest score achieved during the game.
- **Joystick Controller**: Use a virtual analog joystick to control the snake's direction.
